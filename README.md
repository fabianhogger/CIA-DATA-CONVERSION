# CIA UFO data exploration
 According to multiple sources (https://globalnews.ca/news/7573277/cia-ufo-documents-declassified-online/)
 CIA released a big set of files about ufos, but the files are in a bad condition
 and can't be searched through at the time.
 I used the tesseract tool to turn the current pdf documents to readable text(kind of).
 The data were released after a lot of freedom of information acts(FOIA) by the Black Vault organisation
